<h1 align="center"> Libft | 42 School Project </h1>
<h4>My very first own library</h4>
<p>C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project was about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them.</p>
<p>In this repo I only have the initial functions that we were supposed to make. However, when working
on the projects that followed, I have added other functions to this library even thought they are not in this repo</p>
<p>If you are interest to see this library with added functions, such as printf, go to this link -> </p>

<h4>What I learned with this project?</h4>
<p>- I learned how to work with makefiles</p>
<p>- I began understanding linked lists and how to implement them</p>
<p>- I learned how to build a c library</p>
